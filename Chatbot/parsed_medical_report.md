> _Define the reason for the patient’s visit as  specifically as possible._

History of Present Illness

This is the first admission for this 56 year old woman, who states she was in her usual state of good health until one week prior to admission. At that time she noticed the abrupt onset (over a few seconds to a minute) of chest pain which she describes as dull and aching in character. The pain began in the left para-sternal area and radiated up to her neck. The first episode of pain one week ago occurred when she was working in her garden in the middle of the day. She states she had been working for approximately 45 minutes and began to feel tired before the onset of the pain.
> _Convey the acute or chronic nature of the problem and establish a chronology. onset character location radiation circumstances; exacerbating factors_

Her discomfort was accompanied by shortness of breath, but no sweating, nausea, or vomiting. The pain lasted approximately 5 to 10 minutes and resolved when she went inside and rested in a cool area.
> _associated symptoms duration resolution; alleviating factors_

Since that initial pain one week ago she has had 2 additional episodes of pain, similar in quality and location to the first episode. Three days ago she had a 15 minute episode of pain while walking her dog, which resolved with rest. This evening she had an episode of pain awaken her from sleep, lasting 30 minutes, which prompted her visit to the

Emergency Department. At no time has she attempted any specific measures to relieve her pain, other than rest. She describes no other associated symptoms during these episodes of pain, including dizziness, or palpitations. She becomes short of breath during these episodes but describes no other exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. No change in the pain with movement, no association with food, no GERD sx, no palpable pain.

Assessment and Differential Diagnosis

1. Chest pain with features of angina pectoris

This patient’s description of dull, aching, exertion related substernal chest pain is suggestive of ischemic cardiac origin. Her findings of a FH of early ASCVD, hypertension, and early surgical menopause are pertinent risk factors for development of coronary artery disease. Therefore, the combination of this patient’s presentation, and the multiple risk factors make angina pectoris the most likely diagnosis. The pain symptoms appear to be increasing, and the occurrence of pain at rest suggests this fits the presentation of unstable angina, and hospitalization is indicated.
> _In the assessment you take each of the patient’s major problems and draw conclusions, in this case that the chest pain is more likely due to ischemic heart disease instead of other possibilities. You tie in several of the other problems as risk factors for ischemic heart disease, and not merely as random unrelated problems. You should list and extensive justification for your most likely diagnosis. You should also explain why you are less suspicious of alternative diagnoses, such as esophageal reflux disease,_

Other processes may explain her chest pain, but are less likely. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) may occur at night with recumbency, but usually is not associated with exertion. The pain of GERD is usually burning, and the patient describes no associated gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain which might suggest peptic ulcer disease. The presence of dyspnea might suggest a pulmonary component to this patient’s disease process, but the absence of fever, cough or abnormal pulmonary examination findings make a pulmonary infection less likely, and the association of the dyspnea with the chest pain supports the theory that both symptoms may be from ischemic heart disease.
> _pulmonary or musculoskeletal pain._

2. Dyspnea

Her dyspnea may correlate with findings on physical exam of a third heart sound and pulmonary crackles, suggesting left ventricular dysfunction. In that case, she may be manifesting symptoms and findings of congestive heart failure from myocardial ischemia.
> _As in the previous problem, you should explain, in more detail than is shown in this example, why you felt the dyspnea is more likely to be from ischemic heart disease, and not asthma, bronchitis, or other possibilities. Follow this pattern_

3. Recent onset hypertension and abdominal bruit
> _for all subsequent problems._

This combination raises the possibility of a secondary cause of hypertension, specifically ASCVD of the renal artery leading to renovascular hypertension. The lack of hypertensive retinopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy on physical examination further support a recent onset of her

BP elevation.

4. Systolic murmur

The possibility of important valvular heart disease is raised by the murmur, specifically, aortic stenosis. The murmur radiates to the neck as an aortic valvular murmur often does, but a normal carotid upstroke may mean this murmur is not significant.

5. Epigastric discomfort, NSAID use with a history of peptic ulcer disease.

6. Lumbo-sacral back pain

7. Fibrocystic breast disease

8. Penicillin allergy

Plan:

1. Carefully monitor the patient for any increased chest pain that might be indicative of impending myocardial infarction by admitting the patient to the telemetry floor.
> _You should develop a diagnostic and therapeutic plan for the patient. Your plan should incorporate acute and long-term care of the patient’s most likely problem. You should consider pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic_

2. Start platelet inhibitors, such as aspirin to decrease the risk of myocardial infarction; start nitrates to decrease the risk of occlusion and to treat her symptoms of pain. For prolonged pain unresponsive to nitrates, she may need an analgesic such as morphine. The nitrates will also help to lower her BP.
> _measures and be cognizant of the fact that you need to treat the symptoms (i.e. make the patient comfortable) as much as treating the disease when possible. You are expected to know the usual classes of medications used to treat these illnesses._

3. Patient should have her cholesterol monitored and when discharged she should be started on an appropriate exercise and weight loss program, including a low-fat diet. If her cholesterol is elevated, she may need cholesterol-lowering medication such as HMG Co-reductases.

4. Schedule a cardiac catheterization since non-invasive tests have a high pretest probability for being positive and regardless of the result, negative or positive, she will need a cath

5. Begin diuretics for her dyspnea which is most likely secondary to volume overload – this will treat her high BP as well. She should have a ventriculogram with the cath that will assess cardiac size and presence of wall motion abnormalities.

6. Appropriate lab work would include BUN/Creatinine to assess kidney function, electrolytes and baseline EKG.
