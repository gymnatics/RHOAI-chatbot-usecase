{"content": "This patient\u2019s description of dull, aching, exertion related substernal chest pain is suggestive of ischemic cardiac origin. Her findings of a FH of early ASCVD, hypertension, and early surgical menopause are pertinent risk factors for development of coronary artery disease. Therefore, the combination of this patient\u2019s presentation, and the multiple risk factors make angina pectoris the most likely diagnosis. The pain symptoms appear to be increasing, and the occurrence of pain at rest suggests this fits the presentation of unstable angina, and hospitalization is indicated.\n\nComment:\nIn the assessment you take each of the patient\u2019s major problems and draw conclusions, in this case that the chest pain is more likely due to ischemic heart disease instead of other possibilities. You tie in several of the other problems as risk factors for ischemic heart disease, and not merely as random unrelated problems.

The presence of dyspnea might suggest a pulmonary component to this patient\u2019s disease process, but the absence of fever, cough or abnormal pulmonary examination findings make a pulmonary infection less likely, and the association of the dyspnea with the chest pain supports the theory that both symptoms may be from ischemic heart disease.\n\nComment:\npulmonary or musculoskeletal pain.", "metadata": {"source": "UMNwriteup.pdf"}}
