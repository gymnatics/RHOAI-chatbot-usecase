My article has a category `category`. It works well in the root directory, but since the articles also appear in the categories, the relative address which was `content/my_image.jpg` is now translated in `category/content/my_image.jpg`. I see one solution, using the site address to handle these kind of relative addresses: we simply prefix the relative address with the SITEURL value.\n",

My setup is something like this: vhosts.js a/server.js a/views/index.js a/views/athing.js b/server.js b/views/index.js b/views/bthing.js Where vhosts.js is a simple connect server, running through cluster with these vhosts: - a.example.com -> a/server.js - b.example.com -> b/server.js I guess the problem is that both servers have a view like \"./views/index.js\". It seems it attempts to render the view of the server that was visited first, no matter which one of the servers you visit, which causes a crash because both servers don't use the same locals and well, it's just the wrong view being rendered. Could it be that the cache is not using an absolute path for the views? And it used to before 2.2.1?\n",

Put a robots.txt file in content/extra/ and set FILES_TO_COPY = (('extra/robots.txt', 'robots.txt'),) 2. Run \"pelican -s pelican.conf.py\" 3. Look for \"robots.txt\" in output directory. _Expected result:_ \"robots.txt\" present in output directory. _Observed result:_ \"robots.txt\" is **not** present in output directory. Ideally, the committed fix would also include a test that ensures files are being copied successfully, particularly since the sample content already includes an \"extra\" file at `samples/content/extra/robots.txt`.\n",

However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at your own risk. ``` (retcode is not tested). This is simply fixed by removing the sudo from the install.sh script.

See below: ``` paths: { backbone: '../../components/backbone/backbone', jquery: '../../components/jquery/jquery', underscore: '../../components/underscore/underscore', backbone: '../../components/backbone/backbone', // Duplicates from yeoman install backbone underscore: '../../components/underscore/underscore', // Duplicates from yeoman install backbone jquery: 'vendor/jquery.min' // Should be remove manually } ``` Also should the default generator include jQuery via bower or have a different copy? I think you would want to use bower to manage all packages by default. Or it could be a question in the init script/generator.\n",
      "114  Initialized blank yeoman folder with RequireJS configuration. Installed backbone via ``` yeoman install backbone ``` bower successfully installed backbone in the \"components\" folder, downloaded referenced component for underscore, and put it in the same folder. Also it copied backbone.js to the scripts/vendor folder and modified main.js and added paths for backbone and underscore in format ``` 'backbone' : '../../components/backbone' ``` The problem is when I run ``` yeoman server ``` files under components folder are not accessible. I suppose, it would be reasonable to choose consistent way to manage components. The simplest way is to place them inside the \"scripts/vendor\" folder. Another option is to copy them to \"scripts/vendor\" folder, like you do with backbone.js file, but in this case you need to consider what to do with dependencies and updating components, because underscore.js is not copied to \"scripts/vendor\" and has to be copied manually. Also, running ``` yeoman init bbb ``` generates all the dependencies under the \"scripts/libs\" folder and generates correct configuration for require.js. This problem is more about consistent guidelines, I suppose.\n",

Our workflow is based on a common dev machine and we would need to have our own server each. Right now we're using apache virtual document roots, but yeoman looks perfect for our needs if we could use a different port each.\n"
